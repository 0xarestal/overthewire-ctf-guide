Step 1: Look Around
Imagine you're in a virtual room filled with files. To see what's there, type ls and press Enter. It's like checking out the stuff on your desk.

### 'ls'
Step 2: Open the Envelope
Among the files, there's one called "readme." It's like a note waiting to be read. Use the command cat readme and hit Enter to read it:

### 'cat readme'
And boom! You've got the password. Feel free to use it to move forward.
